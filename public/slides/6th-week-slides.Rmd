# How to find a scientific journal article?

1. [**Web of Science through IU library**](https://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=6AGsjNVhsEpTDEx1da1&preferencesSaved=)

2. [**Google Schohlar**](https://scholar.google.com/)

Search by key words. For example:

Question: Does posting more selfies in social media make people feel happier?

Search "selfies, social media, happier" on Google Scholar.

- *Let me take a selfie: Exploring the psychological effects of posting and viewing selfies and groupies on social media*

# How to recap the study and discuss the results as they relate to your question?

Recap: 

- The purpose of the study

- Methods used

- Findings

--

Example

The study by Wang, Yang, and Haigh (2017) looked at the relationship between selfie posting (and viewing), self-esteem, and life satisfactions. They did an online survey on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk where 275 people participated. They found that frequent selfie viewing decreased self-esteem and life satisfaction. Selfie posting, on the other hand, was associated with neither self-esteem nor life satisfaction.

# How to cite a journal article correctly (APA)?

Good sources: [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/apa-citation-guide),
[PSU](https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/apaquickguide/intext) and the [APA guide on Canvas](/files/6-week/apa.pdf)

--
Example:

--
- One author: Galilei (1640) concluded that life sucks. Or: Life sucks (Galilei, 1640)

--

- Two authors: However, Newton and Leibniz (1700) argued this might not be the case. Or: This might not be the case (Newton & Leibniz, 1700)

--
- Three to five authors: Later, Marx, Einstein, and Maxwell (1879) did a study supporting that life sometimes sucks but sometimes doesn't. (When you are citing for the first time) Or: Life sometimes sucks but sometimes doesn't (Marx, Einstein, & Maxwell, 1879).
  
  - Further cites can be shortened: Later, Marx et al. (1879) did ... Or: Later, it was found that ... (Marx et al., 1879)

--

- Six or more authors: Feynman et al. (1980) found that life is wonderful. Or: Life is wonderful (Feynman et al., 1980)

# How does your questions change?

- A new question emerged because of new information?

- A different aspect because it is answered by the article?

--

Example:


Wang et al. (2017) found that selfie posting was not related to life satisfaction, but I wondered whether it was because of the season. I wanted to find out whether posting selfies in Winter will make people feel happier but not in Summer. 

Revised question: Does season have an affect on whether posting selfies make people feel happier?
