# Working title

Requirement: Your game’s title should communicate the gameplay (and, if possible, the style of the game)

Example: Super Mario Bros

(BTW, if you haven't played Super Mario Bros before, try it [here](https://supermarioemulator.com/mario.php).)

# Concept Statement

One or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.

Consider: 

- Who is the player? 

- What does the player do? 

Example: 

The Super Mario Bros game follows Mario's adventures in a fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the player character. Mario runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels.

# Objective of Game

1. Identify the objective(s) in the game 

2. Explaine the objective(s)

Read [Game elements: 2. Objectives](/review/13th-week/#examples-of-games-cores) for reference.

Example: 

The game of Super Mario Bros has two objectives: capture and rescue. The player needs to avoid getting killed while destroying opponents in the Mushroom Kingdom. The rescue objective involves Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Toadstool from the antagonist, Browser.

# Player experience and game POV:

- Who is the player? 

- What is the setting? 

- What is the fantasy the game grants the player? 

- What emotions do you want the player to feel? 

- What are the major phases of the player’s experience in the game?

Example:

Anyone who plays this game is the player. The adventure unfolds in a fictional Mushroom Kingdom. The player gets points every time he jumps atop enemies, or hits special bricks marked with “?” from below. The player may feel happy and excited when he gets these points but may feel sad when he is killed by enemies. The player begins the game with excitement, and may feel frustrated when he fails to reach the end of a level. The player may then feel satisfied when he reaches the end and get to the next level in the game.

# Project Team:

Who will you need to make this game? Think background, design, and other experts.

Example:

First, I need a programmer who can make my ideas into an interactive game. Second, I'll need to a sound designer who can create music and sound effects that fit and enhance my game. Third, I need a graphic designer who can design the appearance of Mario, opponents, Princess Toadstool, bricks, and other elements in the Mushroom Kingdom.

# Platform(s) and primary technology:

Electronic/digital or board/card game? PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? 

Example:

Super Mario Bros will be a 2D digital game played on a video game console or on a smart phone.

# Visual/audio Style: 

- What is the “look and feel” of the game? 

- How does this support the desired player’s experience? 

- Realistic or cartoony? 

Example:

The visual appearance of the Mushroom Kingdom will look very simple: the ground, the sky, the clouds, and trees. It also contains key elements in the game, for example, bricks marked with “?”, enemies, and bottomless pits. The visual style will be cartoony. This simple appearance will keep the player focused on the game itself rather than on external elements, and thus enhance the player’s experience. 

The audio will be short and rhythmic, keeping the player excited, immersed and motivated.

# Game world and progression:

Describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms. 

- How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from tutorial to end? 
- What are their short-term and long-term goals (explicit or implicit)? 
- What skills are needed and how do they chain together?

Example:

Mario collects points by hitting the special bricks. He doubles his body size if he gains a Super Mushroom. He gets additional lives in several ways, including by collecting points and by obtaining a Super Mushroom. The game ends when the player runs out of lives or time. 

The game is comprised of eight worlds with each world containing four sub-level stages. Each final stage takes place in a castle. 

The short term goal of the player is to avoid getting killed and to reach the end of each stage. The long term goal is to rescue the Princess. 

To reach the final state of the final world, the player needs to become skilled at getting power-ups and points, avoiding falling into bottomless pits, and defeating enemies.
