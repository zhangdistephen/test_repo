# 1. Truthfulness of the message

It "requires the persuader’s intention not to deceive, the intention to provide others with the truthful information they legitimately need to make good decisions about their lives" (Baker & Martinson, 2001, p. 160).

---
class: inverse

# Question to ask yourself about Truthfulness 

Is this communication factually accurate and true..? Does it lead people to believe what I myself do not believe?

## Example:

In this ad, we are not deceiving people in any way. Our intention is to bring positive changes in society by asking men to do the right things. Our messages are absolutely truthful and they aim to help men make right decisions in lives.

# 2. Authenticity of the persuader

- The Principle of Authenticity requires persuaders to evaluate the motivations, intentions, and attitudes that drive their persuasive activi- ties, and to act nobly.

- It is important not only to do the right thing, but also to have the requi- site dispositions, motivations, and emotions in being good and doing right.

- Persuaders should sincerely believe that the product will benefit persuadees, and that the persuasion campaign is truthful, respectful, fair, equitable, and responsible.

---
class: inverse

# Question to ask yourself about Authenticity

Does this action compromise my integrity?

## Example

As can be seen in our ad, we not only had the right motivations, but also showed appropriate attitudes and emotions. We patiently listed some bad examples of what men do, and then we wholeheartedly promoted right behaviors. We sincerely believe that what we are advancing will do good to both the audience individually and the whole society.

# 3. Respect for the audience (persuadee)

- It requires that professional persuaders regard other human beings as worthy of dignity, that they not violate their rights, interests, and well-being for raw self-interest or purely client-serving purposes. 

- People should be treated in such a way that they are able to make autonomous and rational choices about how to conduct and arrange their lives according to their own priorities, and that this autonomy should be respected.

---
class: inverse

# Question to ask yourself about Respect

Is the persuasive appeal made to persuade people as rational, self-determining human beings?

## Example:

In our ad, we respect the audience's dignity, rights, interests, and well-being. We highly value the audience's autonomy. We are giving suggestions to the audience about what they should do and what they shouldn't. We are advancing right things men can do in the best interest of society rather than merely our own economic gains.

# 4. Equity of the persuasive appeal

- It is about fairness. It requires that persuaders consider if both the content and the execution of the persuasive appeal are fair and equitable.

- Persuasive claims should not be made beyond the persuadees’ ability to understand both the context and underlying motivations and claims of the persuader.

---
class: inverse

# Question to ask yourself about Equity:

Am I doing to others what I would not want them to do to me or someone I care about? Basically, the “golden rule.” 

(Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” (Mat- thew 7:12))

## Example:

Our persuasive appeal in the ad is both fair and easy to understand. We believe we are treating the audience fairly because we would be very happy to be an audience of similar ads. We are not sacrificing the audience's interest to our own advantage. Also, we have made our message in our ad explicit: average people after watching our ad will understand that we are discouraging bullying, sexual harassment, and toxic masculinity, and are promoting responsible and positive behaviors.

# 5. Social Responsibility

- It focuses on the need for profes- sional persuaders to be sensitive to and concerned about the wider public interest or common good.

- Persuaders “have a responsibility to the societies in which they operate and from which they profit, including obligations of good citizenship in con- tributing positively to the ... health of society"

---
class: inverse

# Question to ask yourself about Social responsibility:

Does this action take responsibility to promote and create the kind of world and society in which persuaders themselves would like to live with their families and loved ones?
Example:

## Example:

We are definitely promoting social good in our ad. We firmly believe that everyone in our society is interdependent and each of us is obliged to do the right things. Through this ad, we are advancing a world where bullying, sexual harassment, and toxic masculinity are intolerable. We are promoting ideas that will do good rather than harm to society and we do this not for our own narrow profitable goals. Therefore, we have fulfilled our social responsibility as a company and as a marketer.
