# 2. Shot description

Simply describe the shot. For example <sup>1</sup>:

- Close-up of the flowers next to the woman, the camera tilts up and zooms to identical flowers held by the woman in the painting

or

- The man, clearly worried, exits the frame, moving to the right.

# 3. Sound

See more information about **sound** in Prof. Tim Bell's [fourth video](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Analyzing+film+4A+shot+analysis+assignment/1_xcmp4qe0). 

For this assignemnt, you are only required to specify whether it's **Diegetic** or **Non-Diegetic**.

- Diegetic: Coming from inside the story (the current shot); characters can also hear it. 

- Non-diegetic: Coming from outside the current shot; Only we can hear and the characters cannot. 

Some examples of Non-diegetic sound <sup>1</sup>:

- narrator's commentary
- sound effects which are added for the dramatic effect
- mood music

# Point-of-view (POV) editing

We start with a close-up of a character looking at something, followed by a shot of what he or she is looking at. Then we go back to their close-up to see their reactions. 

# Eyeline matches

The illusion of a character looking at something in another shot, created through framing and editing

# Match on action

An action started in one shot is completed in another, giving us the illustion that we are watching one complete action.
