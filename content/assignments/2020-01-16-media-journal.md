# Description:

For this short project you will track your media consumption for 24 hours. In your journal, keep track of what media you consume, how it is paid for (both direct and indirect funding), and what technologies/platforms you use to consume it. The information from this project will be used for future class projects.

Each entry should include the following information:

1. The date and time periods of media consumption. Take care to indicate when your media consumption overlaps -- people often are exposed to more than one medium or message (content) simultaneously. Don't forget to account for the full 24-hour period. If you sleep with music playing, list that, too, for example.

2. Any print, broadcast or digital media content (books, newspapers, magazines, television, film, video games, music, online news, Kindle books, podcasts) that you consumed during the period (intentionally or not!).

3. How it was paid for (direct payment, subscription, subsidized by advertisements, etc.) You should indicate the way it was paid for even if someone else pays for it (for example, a family Netflix subscription that you do not pay for)

4. What media technologies/platforms/outlets you used to consume it (i.e. cable television, movie theater, DVD on laptop, Hulu on television using a Roku, HBO app on smartphone, etc.)

You may not always immediately know the answers to these questions; please think about likely sources of payment or different kinds of technology.

Additionally, we are not going to comment on or punish you for nontraditional means of consuming media (othersâ€™ accounts, downloading, streaming, etc.). Be honest so that you can reflect on your choices as the semester goes on.
