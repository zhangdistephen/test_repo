This week's assignment requires you **to create your own game**. You will specify the game's target audience, objective, and product design (system elements). Please use this [Template](/files/13-week/Template.docx/), and refer to [Example](/files/13-week/Example_Super_Mario_Bros.pdf/)


# NOTE:
You are required to **creat your own game**, rather than analyzing an existing game. I used Super Mario Bros in the Example simply for the purpose of illustration.
