### Scenario:

First of all, the pandemic is over and people are able to get back together again.

A new Bloomington café will soon be opening. Its aim is to offer organic, free trade, and/or locally sourced coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and salads. As a Public Relations professional, first develop a name for this cafe. 

Next, how would you increase public awareness of Coffee House’s opening and generate a customer base?  Use the course information from this week's classes and from the assigned reading to help you with different sections of this [worksheet](/files/15-week/Template.docx/).
