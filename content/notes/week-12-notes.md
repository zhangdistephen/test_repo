First Video:

- Long shot: who whole body plus some above/below (but not too much)
- Medium shot: from the waist up
- Close-up (near) full frame of face or other object

Please see Tim Bell's first video to have a deeper understanding of this.


Second Video:
Continuity editing

Point-of-view editing: we start with a close-up of a character looking at something, followed by a shot of what they are looking at. Then we go back to their close-up to see their reactions. 

point-of-view editing, two valuable functions:
1. Gives us insight into what the character is thinking and feeling without resorting to voiceover
2. Creats the illusion of seamlessness of time and space


Eyeline matches: the illusion of a character looking at something in another shot, created through framing and editing

Match on action: continuation of action between two shots

Match on action: an action started in one shot is completed in another, giving us the illustion that we are watching one complete action. 

Screen direction: action continues in the same relative direction between shots. This is also called the **180 degree rule**. 

Some films do not conform to these conventions, for example *The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover* by Perter Greenaway, 1989

Third Video:

Ideology: American films tend to objectify women. 

Fourth video:
Sound (Belton, 57-58): Foley; Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic; "Star Miking" and selective use of sound; Sound and Continuit

Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic
Diegetic: Coming inside the current shot

non-diegetic: Coming from outside the current shot; not part of the actors' world; we can hear but people in the shot cannot hear

Some examples of Non-diegetic sount:

- narrator's commentary
- sound effects which is added for the dramatic effect
- mood music
