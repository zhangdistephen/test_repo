some wrong comments:
- media is biased
- too much violence in the media
- too much media usage make people anti-social
- ...
- all in all, technology is not the problem. It is how people use it that causes problems.

Difference between "media" and "the media":
- the media: people will associate negative things with "the media"

Media is a plural of medium. It is wrong to term the "media" so broadly. We should be more specific in identifying type of media: 
- News or information media
- Entertainment media
- Social media
- ..
We should know that these categories are based on their **purpose**

The primary goal of media companies is to make profits. 

For journalists, there is a clash between making money and informing the public. Making money is more important.
