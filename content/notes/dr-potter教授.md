Dr. Rob Potter:

Media Science tries to precisely and systematically analyze what is in media, how people use media, their attitudes toward media, and how media affects people. 

## Some goals of scientific observation:

- To describe

- To explain

- to predict

In most social science, these goals are achieved using three main methods:


1. Content analysis:

- Deciding the time frame, the population frame, and the sampling technique

- using trained coders to systematically quantifying media content

In media science, it is very important that you are clear about definitions.


2. Survey research:

- asking people to self-report information about the media (and other things)

- Behaviors, attitudes, opinions

- Mail, face-to-face, phone, web


Extract what you do understand, and leave what you don't alone. 

3. Experimental research

- trying to establish causal relationships between two or more variables
