# Topic: Media owenership

Good source of information is important for people to elect for the President. 

Media conglomerates are a result of deregulation of media business. 

## Possible negative influences of concentrated media ownership

1. Harm to the economy and society;
2. Increase in barriers for new companies;
3. Powerful will filter out information they do not like.

## Possible benefits of concentrated ownership

1. Overall economy gets strengthended when individual companies become stronger;
2. Larger companies have the power to battle unfair government leaders and policies whereas smaller media organizations do not.

## American Media Myth

- The US believed the private sector will provide the best information for the American public under a capitalistic system;
- The government should have little involvment in media business.

## American Media Reality

- From the start of US, the govenment has been heaviliy involved in promoting or censoring specific information;
- Private companies have often turned to the govenment for protection against competition.

## Why limit legacy radio
1. Few frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum;
2. Radio needed to be regulated;

### How did the govenment regulate radio
- The FCC divided the country into many local market areas and awarded some frequencies to each market.

## Television
During the 1940s, the FCC used the same procedure of allocating broadcasting licenses to TV stations. 

## The trend toward media concentration
- 1983: Ben Bagdikian found that the control of the media was essentially in the hands of 50 people, the CEOs of the largest media companies;
- 1980 & 1990s: Mergers and acquisitions became more and more popular because they are so profitable;
- 2011 to 2012: The number of mergers among media related companies more than doubled. 

## Telecommunication Act of 1996
- Called for deregulation of the media industries;
- Eliminated the longstanding restriction of allowing one company to own two television stations in the same market;
- Result: 1996: $25 billion in merger activity in the broadcasting industry and another $23 billion the cable industry.

## Three types of business merger
- Horizontal merger: media company of same type;
- Vertical merger: supplier and/or distributors; integrate productio and distribution;
- Conglomerate merger: combination of media companies and/or non-media business

The federal govenment instituted policies to encourage diversity of ownership within the mass media industries in the 20th Century.

## Barriers to entering the business 
- Entry barriers into the legacy radio and legacy television broadcasting business have always been very high. 
- However, the Internet decreases those barriers.
