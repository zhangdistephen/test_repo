# Some wrong comments:
- Media is biased
- Too much violence in the media
- Too much media usage make people anti-social
- ...
- All in all, technology is not the problem. It is how people use it that causes problems.

# Difference between "media" and "the media":
The media: people will associate negative things with "the media"

Media is a plural of medium. It is wrong to term the "media" so broadly. We should be more specific in identifying type of media: 
- News or information media
- Entertainment media
- Social media
- ..
We should know that these categories are based on their **purpose**

# Profiting and informing

- The primary goal of media companies is to make profits. 

- For journalists, there is a clash between **making money** and **informing the public**.
