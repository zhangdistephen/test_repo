# Shot Size

Note: Please see Professor Tim Bell's [first video](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Analyzing+film+1A+The+basics/1_cj175nto) to have a deeper understanding of this.

- Long shot: who whole body plus some above/below (but not too much)

- Medium shot: from the waist up

- Close-up (near) full frame of face or other object


# Editing

Note: Please see Professor Tim Bell's [second video](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Analyzing+film+2A+Continuity+editing/1_780nzqxp) to have a deeper understanding of this.

##  Point-of-View (POV) Editing
We start with a close-up of a character looking at something, followed by a shot of what they are looking at. Then we go back to their close-up to see their reactions. 

Two valuable functions:

1. Gives us insight into what the character is thinking and feeling without resorting to voiceover.

2. Creates the illusion of seamlessness of time and space.

## Eyeline Matches
The illusion of a character looking at something in another shot, created through framing and editing

### Difference between POV editing and eyeline matches

You can see eyeline matches as part of POV editing. The difference is that eyeline matches does not have the third component of POV editing, i.e., goting back to the characters' close-ups to see their reactions. 

## Match on Action
An action started in one shot is completed in another, giving us the illustion that we are watching one complete action. 

## Screen direction
Action continues in the same relative direction between shots. This is also called the **180 degree rule**. 

# Ideology

Note: Please see Professor Tim Bell's [third video](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/id/1_eovz3qru?width=400&height=285&playerId=26683571) to have a deeper understanding of this.

American films tend to objectify women. 

# Sound

Note: Please see Professor Tim Bell's [fourth video](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Analyzing+film+4A+shot+analysis+assignment/1_xcmp4qe0) to have a deeper understanding of this.

## Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic

Diegetic: Coming inside the current shot

Non-diegetic: Coming from outside the current shot; not part of the actors' world; we can hear but people in the shot cannot hear

Some examples of Non-diegetic sount:

- narrator's commentary
- sound effects which is added for the dramatic effect
- mood music 

These examples come from [here](http://www.filmsound.org/terminology/diegetic.htm)
