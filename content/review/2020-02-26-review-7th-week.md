Definition: viewing new technologies as powerful agents of change in society, as active forces that humans have trouble resisting. This view is most common when technology is new.

2. Social construction of technology

Definition: seeing people as the primary sources of change in technology and society; technology influences people and vice-versa; ultimately new technology is domesticated (taken for granted as part of everyday life).

## Technology determinism

Old argument: communication technologies make us dumber

- Socrates saw writing as threat to oral communication

- Quick editing in film and TV shortens attention span

- Use of mobile devices cause people to lose their sense of belonging to be place and their interpersonal skills

- [Nicholas Carr](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3700/v12/undervisningsmateriale/Is%20Google%20Making%20Us%20Stupid.pdf) argued that Google is making people stupid

## Milder forms of technological determinism

Media choice = use of technology has direct consequences, but people make strategic, usually rational choices.

  - "You are what you eat" thinking

  - Investors
