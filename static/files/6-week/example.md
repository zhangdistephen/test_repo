# Question: 

Does posting more selfies in social media make people feel happier? 

I have many friends on Facebook and many of them post selfies very often. They always smile brightly in their selfies and I wondered whether posting selfies makes people happier. 

# Scientific study: 

The study by Wang, Yang, and Haigh (2017) looked at the relationship between selfie posting (and viewing), self-esteem, and life satisfactions. They did an online survey on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk where 275 people participated. They found that frequent selfie viewing decreased self-esteem and life satisfaction. Selfie posting, on the other hand, was associated with neither self-esteem nor life satisfaction. 

# Revised question: 

Selfie posting was not related to life satisfaction (Wang et al., 2017), but I wondered whether it was because of seasons. I wanted to find out whether posting selfies in Winter makes people feel happier whereas posting in Summer doesn't. Therefore, I revised my question as follows:

Do seasons have an effect on whether posting selfies makes people feel happier?
