# 1. Basic News Leads

- The summary lead: The one we just used.

- The delayed identification lead:

A college student at Kindiana University was sent to the hospital after he opened an unusual Amazon package. 

Mike, 22, a sophomore studying cosmology, saw an alien in the package and passed out. "I was scared to death." He recalled.

# 2. Anecdotal / Narrative Leads
> Some stories unfold slowly, as the writer eases into the topic with an engaging or meaningful anecdote. 
Back in 2099, Mike was a sophomore studying cosmology at Kindiana University. He started a relationship with Emma, a Physics major, two years ago. A week before Valentine's Day, he bought a rose as a gift for Emma from Amazon. When he was making the payment, Amazon asked whether he wanted a surprise in the package.

"I like surprises and I thought 'Why not have the surprise from Amazon. Maybe they'll put 1 million dollar check in there'"

Six days later, when he returned from the gym, he saw the package in front of his door. He opened it and got shocked...

# 3. Scene-setting leads

It was a dark and stormy night. Mike was sleeping at home. Several knocks on the door waked him up. He opened the door and saw his Amazon package. What he saw later scared him to death...

# 4. Blind Leads

> More extreme versions of the delayed identification leads. You tease readers by withholding a key piece of information, then spring it on them in a subsequent paragraph.
Mike never thought he would appear in the news. He was just a normal college student like everyone else. Everything changed when he opened the Amazon package two days ago. 

There was an alien in it. When he clicked "Yes. I allow a surprise in my package" on Amazon, he didn't expect an alien. But there the alien was, first knocked Mike unconscious and then knocked him back into consciousness. Then the alien flew out of the window.

# 5. Roundup Leads

Impress the reader with a long list:

>Steven Spielberg would want to make a film of it. Jackie Chan wouldn't dare to fight at this scene. President Donald Trump would call it fake news. Kylie Jenner would want a selfie there. Even Sheldon, who claims to know a lot, would doubt his IQ after hearing it. 

An alien appeared in an Amazon package.

# 6. Direct Address Leads

> Use the second-person voice to speak directly to you, the reader.
You want to buy your girlfriend a rose for Valentine's Day. You buy it on Amazon. Several days later, after working out at the gym, you get back home and find the package in front of your door. You open it carelessly while open the door. Suddenly, an alien jumped outside of package. How would you reack?

Mike passed out.
