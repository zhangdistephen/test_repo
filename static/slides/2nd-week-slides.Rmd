# Key Point 1.1: Some wrong comments:
- Media is biased

- Too much violence in the media

- Too much media usage make people anti-social

- ...

# Key Point 1.2: "media" and "the media"
Difference between "media" and "the media":

- The media: people will associate negative things with "the media"

- Media is a plural of medium. It is wrong to term the "media" so broadly. We should be more specific in identifying type of media:

   1. News or information media
   
   2. Entertainment media
   
   3. Social media
   
   4. ...
   
- We should know that these categories are based on their **purpose**.

class: inverse

# Key Point 1.3: profiting or informing

- The primary goal of media companies is to make **profits**. 

- For journalists, there is a clash between **making money** and **informing the public**.
